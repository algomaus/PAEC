Error-Profile-Aware Correction of Next-Generation Sequencing Reads

This is the toolkit prototype I implemented in my Master Thesis. The thesis can be found at https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/pubs/masterSarah.pdf

I am currently working on a way better error correction framework for NGS data. It will be released in another GitHub repository.
